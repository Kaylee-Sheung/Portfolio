      <img id="selfie" src="./images/Me.JPG" alt="selfie">
      <p>I am now studying at Parsons, School of Design, located in New York City, USA.</p>
      <p>My major is Design & Technology, mostly working on Javascript, html and technical designs.</p>
      <p>My study experiences is super interesting, I have studied in Beijing (China), Shen Zhen (China), 
        Hong Kong (China), Brisbane (Australia), St. Louis (US) and New York (US), so I have strong adaptability.</p>
      <p>I am patient and hard-working, with high working efficiency and active mind, 
          I can also accept new ideas and opinions from other people. 
          I completed the IB Diploma program in my middle school and high school, 
          so I am also used to group works, besides that, I am often the leader in my group, 
          for me, it is interesting to communicate with people and organise different works for them.</p>

      <h2>Work Experiences</h2>
      <p>I also have some working experiences, I have had an internship in 2020 summer, 
        a game company located in China, 
        I was in the strategy department dealing with the main products in their game. 
        We have to communicate with different groups, 
        especially technology department and design department, 
        to make sure the final product is well made. 
        Sometimes I also have to work on fixing designs and testing the coding.</p>
